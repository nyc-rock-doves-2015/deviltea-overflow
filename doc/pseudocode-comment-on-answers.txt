As a User, I should be able to comment on answers.

Implemented by: Lucian

Pseudocode:

WORKING ON:
2. Create a comment form partial. Give it a hidden field that passes in its parent element.

TO DO:
3. Write a test to determine that a comment knows what it's commenting upon. Pass it
a stub answer to be a comment on.
4. To pass the test: Create the comment in the comment controller. Provide logic in the comment controller to assign a parent ID to the comment.
5. Make a comment view to display the comment.




DONE:
1. Add resources :comments to routes.
